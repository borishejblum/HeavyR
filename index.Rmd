# Course syllabus {-}

The main goal of this course is to give you tools that ease (high-performing and effcient) code development with `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`. The *performance* side will come as a second part, and the initial tools introduced are also very useful in situations that do not require
important computation times.

We will focus the presentation of these development tools on the notion of **package**. *You are already familiar with this notion*, as you have already
already installed packages from the CRAN for example ! You also know that it is the most standard way in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` to distribuute code and make it available.
We will show you that the package is also an excellent tool for developing code.


We will follow the outline below:

 1. Build an `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` package as a useful tool for code development

 2. Leverage `git` for **tracking** changes, and `GitHub` for **sharing** code, **collaborative** development, automating tests in a package and broadcast a companion website

 3. **Measure** computation time

 4. **Profile** the code

 5. Use `Rcpp` to **optimize** what needs to be optimized

 6. **Parallelize** the code easily


## Required tools {-}

To take this course, you will need to have the following softwares installed:

  - the latest version of `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` (https://cloud.r-project.org/)

  - the latest version of `RStudio` (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download)

  - a *C++ compiler* (such as `gcc` or `clang` - native on UNIX systems, 
	for Windows users we recommend installing 
	[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), for 
	Mac users it may be necessary to install the macOS tool chain as detailed [here](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/)

  - the following `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` packages: `devtools`, `future.apply`, `itertools`, `microbenchmark`, `mvtnorm`, `profvis`, `Rcpp`, `RcppArmadillo`, `roxygen2`, `testthat`, `usethis`

  - the software [*git*](https://git-scm.com/) which can be installed following instructions from [*Happy Git With R* by Jenny Brian](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
  
In addition, you will need an active internet connection (e.g. through *eduroam*)

**NB:** In case you have not the sufficient admin rights on your computer to install some of those tools, you can instead use the service [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) offered Posit (the company developing *RStudio*) signing up for their free plan. This will give you access to a remote *RStudio* session with all the necessary softwares available, leaving you only with the above list of packages to install.


## Prerequisites {-}

To be able to follow along this training, you must be comfortable with the following concepts: 

  - programing with `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` within the `RStudio` IDE
  - writing functions in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`
  - control structures, particularly *for* loops
  - the calculation of the density for a multivariate Gaussian distribution
