# `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` code Parallelization

## Introduction to parallel execution in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`

Apart from optimizing the code and the algorithms, another way to get a high performing code is to take advantage of the parallel architectures of modern computers. The goal is then to **parallelize** one's code in order to perform simultaneous operations on distinct parts of the same problem, using different computing cores. This does not reduce the total computation time needed, but the set of operations is executed faster, resulting in overall user speed-up.

There is a significant number of algorithms that are so-called "*embarrassingly parallel*", i.e. whose computations can be broken down into several independent sub-computations. In statistics, it is often easy and straightforward to parallelize according to different observations or different dimensions. Typically, these are operations that can be written in the form of a loop whose operations are independent from one iteration to the next.

**The necessary operations to execute code in parallel are as follows:**

  1. Start $m$ "worker" processes (i.e. computing cores) and initialize them
  
  2. Send the necessary functions and data for each task to the workers
  
  3. Split the tasks into $m$ operations of similar size and send them to the workers
  
  4. Wait for all workers to finish their calculations
  
  5. Collect the results from the different workers
  
  6. Stop the worker processes


Depending on the platform, several communication protocols are available between the cores. Under UNIX systems, the *Fork* protocol is the most used, but it is not available under Windows where the *PSOCK* protocol is used instead. Finally, for distributed computing architecture where the cores are not necessarily on the same physical processor, the *MPI* protocol is generally used. The advantage of the `future` and `future.apply` package API is that the same code can be executed whatever the hardware configuration.

Since `R 2.14.0`, the [`parallel` package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf) is directly included in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` and allows to start and stop a cluster of several worker processes (step 1 and 6). In addition to the `parallel` package, we will use the `future` package which allows to manage the worker processes and the communication and articulation with the `future.apply` package, which in turn allows to manage the dialogue with the workers (sending, receiving and collecting the results -- steps 2, 3, 4 and 5).

`microbenchmark(log_par(1:100), log_seq(1:100), times=10)`


```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(microbenchmark)
library(future.apply)

log_seq <- function(x){
  # try this yourself (spoiler alert: it is quite long...):
  # res <- numeric(length(x))
  # for(i in 1:length(x)){
  #   res[i] <- log(x[i])
  # }
  # return(res)
  return(log(x))
}

log_par <- function(x){
  res <- future_sapply(1:length(x), FUN = function(i) {
    log(x[i])
  })
  return(res)
}

plan(multisession(workers = 3))
mb <- microbenchmark(log_par(1:100), log_seq(1:100), times = 50)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval =FALSE}
log_parIter <- function(x, ncores = 1){
  iter <- itertools::isplitIndices(n=length(x), chunks=ncores)
  res <- future_sapply(iter, FUN = function(i) {
    log(x[i])
  })
  return(unlist(res))
}
mb <- microbenchmark(log_par(1:100), log_parIter(1:100), times=50)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data2plot <- cbind.data.frame("Time" = mb$time/10^6, "Expression" = mb$expr)
rangeTime <- c(floor(log10(min(data2plot$Time))):ceiling(log10(max(data2plot$Time))))
brk <- NULL
for(i in rangeTime){
    brk <- c(brk, seq(from = 10^i, to = 10^(i+1), by=10^i))
}
ggplot(data2plot) + geom_violin(aes(x=Expression, y=Time, fill=Expression), alpha=0.8)  +
  scale_fill_manual(guide="none", values=viridis::viridis(6)[1:4]) + 
  scale_y_log10(minor_breaks=brk) + 
  ylab("Execution timings (milli-sec)") +
  xlab("Computed expression") +
  annotation_logticks(sides="l") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Spoiler alert")
```

The parallel version runs much slower... Because in fact, if the individual tasks are too fast, `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` will spend more time communicating with the cores than doing the actual computations.

**A loop iteration must be relatively long for parallel computing to provide a significant gain in computation time!**

By increasing $n$, we observe a reduction in the difference between the 2 implementations (the parallel computation time increases very slowly compared to the increase of the sequential function).

**NB:** the iterators of the `itertools` package are very efficient to minimize the number of communications between cores, but can only be used when the code inside `future_*apply()` is vectorized (it is always possible to vectorize the code inside, for example with a function of type `apply`).




## Efficient parallelization

We will now look at another use case. Let's say we have a large array of data with 10 observations for 100,000 variables (e.g. genetic measurements), and we want to compute the median for each of these variables.

```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(1e6), nrow = 10)
dim(x)
```

For an experienced `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")` user, such an operation is easily implemented using `apply()`:

```{r}
colmedian_apply <- function(x){
  return(apply(x, 2, median))
}
system.time(colmedian_apply(x))
```

In reality, a (good) `for` loop is no slower -- provided it is nicely programmed:

```{r}
colmedian_for <- function(x){
  ans <- rep(0, ncol(x)) 
  for (i in 1:ncol(x)) {
    ans[i] <- median(x[, i]) 
  }
  return(ans)
}
system.time(colmedian_for(x))
```

> 2. Propose an alternative implementation using the `itertools::isplitIndices()` function which allows you to separate your data (the $n$ numbers) into as many groups (or batchs) as you have cores. Compare again the computation times.

```{r, error=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
colmedian_par <- function(x){
  res <- future_sapply(1:ncol(x), FUN = function(i) {
          median(x[, i])
    })
  return(res)
}
plan(multisession(workers = 3))
system.time(colmedian_par(x))

colmedian_parIter <- function(x, ncores = 1){
  iter <- itertools::isplitIndices(n = ncol(x), chunks = ncores)
  res <- future_sapply(iter, FUN = function(i) {
          apply(x[, i], 2, median)
    })
  return(unlist(res))
}
system.time(colmedian_parIter(x, ncores = 3))

mb <- microbenchmark(colmedian_apply(x), 
                     colmedian_for(x),
                     colmedian_par(x),
                     colmedian_parIter(x, ncores = 3), times = 10)
mb
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data2plot <- cbind.data.frame("Time" = mb$time/10^9, "Expression" = mb$expr)
rangeTime <- c(floor(log10(min(data2plot$Time))):ceiling(log10(max(data2plot$Time))))
brk <- NULL
for(i in rangeTime){
    brk <- c(brk, seq(from = 10^i, to = 10^(i+1), by=10^i))

###  Iterators

The `itertools` package allows to easily split data or tasks (step 3) while minimizing communication with different workers. It is based on an implementation of iterators in `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`. However, its use requires vectorizing the code inside `future_*apply()`. Experiment with the small code below: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
myiter <- itertools::isplitIndices(n = 30, chunks = 3)

# a first time
iterators::nextElem(myiter)
# a second time... Oh ?!
iterators::nextElem(myiter)
# again !
iterators::nextElem(myiter)
# again ?
iterators::nextElem(myiter)
```


### Other "plans" for parallel computations

To run your code (exactly the same code, this is one of the advantages of the `future*` family packages), you need to set up a "plan" of computations:

- On a computer (or a single computer server) under Unix (Linux, Mac OS), you can use `plan(multicore(workers = XX))` which is often more efficient. The multisession plan always works.

- on a HPC cluster (like Avakas in Bordeaux), we refer to the package [`future.batchtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future.batchtools/vignettes/future.batchtools.html)

## Conclusion

Parallel computation saves time, but first you have to optimize your code. When parallelizing a code, the gain on the execution time depends above all on the ratio between the communication time and the effective computation time for each task.
